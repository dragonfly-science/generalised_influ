# Generalising influ to arbitrary models

Nokome Bentley's R package `influ` was developed for use with frequentist models 
fitted in R using the `glm` function. 

D Weber's `infu2` package is the Bayesian counterpart and has been developed for use with `brms`. It works with 
population-level or group-level effects, the Bayesian equivalents of 
fixed-effects and random-effects.

The persent project explores how the influ concept can be generalised across model types and implementations.
